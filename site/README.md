# WeWere landing page

`index.html` is the whole site — one file, fonts from Google Fonts, no build step.
The APK is served from the same folder, so the download button is a relative link.

## Deploy (Vercel)

1. `./gradlew assembleRelease`
2. Copy `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` here as `WeWere.apk`
3. Update the version, size and SHA-256 in `index.html`
4. `npx vercel --prod` from this folder (first time: `npx vercel login`)

`vercel.json` sets the APK's content type so phones treat it as an installable
package. The APK itself is git-ignored in this folder.
